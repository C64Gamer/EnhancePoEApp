# `EnhancePoEApp/ChaosRecipeEnhancer.UI/DynamicControls`

Any classes and methods related to UI components that are exclusively generated programatically as a result of some business logic should be housed within this directory.

If a control is housed independent of some business logic, consider moving them to the `UserControls` or `View` directories instead.
