##  F.A.Q.

#### The tool seems to not pick the right stash tabs

Make sure you do NOT have "Remove-only Stash tabs" hidden. They will still be counted, even if you can't see them. That means the index will be off. 

This will also apply to Event Stash tabs. When you are playing in an event, check if you have Remove-only Tabs from events before. You can check your stash tab IDs by searching this address in your browser (replace YOURACCOUNTNAME and YOURLEAGUE accordingly):

https://www.pathofexile.com/character-window/get-stash-items?accountName=YOURACCOUNTNAME&league=YOURLEAGUE&tabs=1

It will output all your stash tabs currently available. 

#### The tool cannot find my account

If you are a steam user, make sure you have linked your steam account to your PoE account on the website

#### The highlighting in Stash Tab Overlay seems off

If you have changed your Display Scaling in Windows (Display Settings -> Scale and layout) it will not get the right mouse positions. Set it to 100%.

#### The highlighting in Stash tab Overlay shows items already sold

Make sure you do not close the overlay while selling. The data cannot be refreshed that fast, that means the tool calculates an order for picking the items out of your stash. This order will start from the beginning if you closed the overlay and did not fetch before. So just leave it open while selling.

#### The Stash tab Overlay is not aligned

You can align it yourself by going in edit mode. Press "Edit" on top of the Stash tab Overlay and drag the Stash tab Overlay (at the top) around. In the bottom right corner there is a grip to resize the Stash tab Overlay.

#### Is this tool safe?
You can check and compile the source code for yourself, so it should be safe as long as you are downloading it from here. DO NOT download from any other locations and ensure you're downloading from our original repository.

#### Can I get banned for using this tool?
Well, I contacted GGG but as usual they don't answer any questions regarding legality of 3rd party tools. As this tool does not interfere with any game files directly, the answer is: probably no!

Although there are 2 points which could be problematic:
1. The tool fetches data from PoE servers repeatedly, so they could think you are stressing the servers too much. That is why I limited the refresh rate a bit. One request per one second. 
2. The tool manipulates your loot filter. I'm not sure if they are considered "game files" by GGG, personally I wouldn't consider them like that. The tool certainly doesn't interact with the game client in any way. But if you are unsure you can deactivate this feature and only use the overlay.
