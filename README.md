# The PoE Chaos Recipe Enhancer

**This product isn't affiliated with or officially endorsed by Grinding Gear Games in any way.**

This app fetches your stash data from the PoE servers and shows which items you need to pick up for the chaos, regal, or exalted shard recipe. Optionally, it can also manipulate your loot filter, so you can go full brain-dead while farming! While selling your stuff it shows you what items to put in your inventory in which order. Great for some quick and easy chaos, specifically during league starts!
