# `EnhancePoEApp/ChaosRecipeEnhancer.UI/Extensions`

Any classes and methods not belonging to a particular piece of business logic of app UI belong here.

The idea is to split the different extensions by domain (i.e. classes and methods that make it easier to interact with native Windows functionality).

If a piece of 'logical' code coincides with a specific business process, consider moving it to `BusinessLogic`.
