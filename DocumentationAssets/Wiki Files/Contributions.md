## Contributions

Some steps to follow if you want to start contributing to the project:

0. Download and install [.NET Framework 4.8 SDK (Not just the runtime)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
    - Note: I _highly_ recommend Visual Studio as your IDE of choice for this project, you can install with the VS installer
1. Download the latest version of the [Wix Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/)
2. Download and install the [Wix Toolset Extension for Visual Studio 2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WixToolset.WixToolsetVisualStudio2022Extension)
3. Try your best to work on your own branch. All branches should go in either the 'feature' or 'bugfix' folder, respectively. All branches should spawn from the latest version of develop.
    - So, for instance, 'feature/cool-new-button' or 'bugfix/fixing-cool-button'
4. Once your work is done, please PR it into 'develop', and NOT 'master' (else, I'll just auto-reject the PR)
5. If you could ping me on Discord that would be awesome, especially if you want to make bigger changes. It'll probably be the quickest way to talk to me about code reviews, new features, design, etc.

Help is always appreciated, and we can never get enough of it. Thanks again for everyone's support and contributions to the project.

Cheers, and stay sane, exiles!
